# Real Time Anomaly Segmentation
In the context of existing deep networks, their performance diminishes significantly when confronted with unknown or anomalous objects that were not part of their training data. The ability to detect such out-of-distribution (OoD) objects is crucial, especially in applications like autonomous driving and various computer vision challenges such as continual learning and open-world scenarios.

In this project, the objective was to develop compact anomaly segmentation models capable of real-time deployment. The aim was to create models that could run efficiently on small devices, aligning with the memory constraints typically encountered in edge applications. Specifically, the focus was on designing models suitable for deployment on smart cameras with limited onboard processing capacity.
